## Run Locally

You can run the project locally using the **Expo Go app** or an **iOS Simulator**. However, some features that require native code (such as Bluetooth Low Energy - BLE) will not be available in this mode.  
For full functionality, consider building a development binary and testing from there.

## Building

Building and deployment to the Apple Developer account is managed by **Expo**.  
To build and submit the app, use the following commands:

```bash
# For development build
npm run build:dev
npm run submit:dev

# For production build
npm run build:prod
npm run submit:prod
```
